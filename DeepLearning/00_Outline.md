# Introduction to Deep Learning

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning technique that uses deep neural networks to extract features from data. Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in different types of data and make predictions based on their learning. For example, a deep learning model can learn to recognize faces or objects in a picture.

### Deep Learning in Bioinformatics

Just like pattern recognition in a picture, a model can also learn to recognize patterns in genetic sequences, protein structures, and other biological data. This capability can enable more in depth understanding of biological processes. Deep learning models can utilize large datasets to learn complex relations and patterns in biological data such as DNA/RNA/protein sequences to make predictions.

## What are Deep Neural Networks?

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected neuronsâ€”simple units that receive input, process it, and pass on their output to the next layer. There are three layers in a simple neural network, an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. A neural network is considered "deep" when it has more than one hidden layer.

## Types of Learning in Deep Neural Networks

In deep neural networks, learning can be categorized into three major types:
* **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data, trying to predict the output from the input data. It adjusts its weights based on the error between its predictions and the actual labels.

* **Unsupervised Learning**: The model learns patterns from unlabeled data without any explicit instructions on what to predict. It tries to find the structure or relationships within the data.

* **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve some goals. It learns from the rewards or penalties it receives for its actions.
